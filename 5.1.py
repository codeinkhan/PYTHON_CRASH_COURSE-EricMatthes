#5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.
#       Your code should look something like this:

#        car = 'subaru'
#        print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
#        print(car == 'subaru')

#       print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
#       print(car 'audi')

#       Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False. Create at least 10 tests.
#       Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.


# Test 1: Is the number 5 greater than 3?
print("Is 5 > 3? I predict True.")
print(5 > 3)

# Test 2: Is 'apple' equal to 'banana'?
print("\nIs 'apple' == 'banana'? I predict False.")
print('apple' == 'banana')

# Test 3: Is 10 + 20 equal to 30?
print("\nIs 10 + 20 == 30? I predict True.")
print(10 + 20 == 30)

# Test 4: Is the length of 'hello' greater than 6?
print("\nIs len('hello') > 6? I predict False.")
print(len('hello') > 6)

# Test 5: Is 'cat' not equal to 'dog'?
print("\nIs 'cat' != 'dog'? I predict True.")
print('cat' != 'dog')

# Test 6: Is 15 less than or equal to 20?
print("\nIs 15 <= 20? I predict True.")
print(15 <= 20)

# Test 7: Is 7 multiplied by 3 greater than 25?
print("\nIs 7 * 3 > 25? I predict False.")
print(7 * 3 > 25)

# Test 8: Is the result of 12 divided by 4 equal to 3?
print("\nIs 12 / 4 == 3? I predict True.")
print(12 / 4 == 3)

# Test 9: Is 'hello' in the string 'Hello, World!' (case-sensitive)?
print("\nIs 'hello' in 'Hello, World!'? I predict False.")
print('hello' in 'Hello, World!')

# Test 10: Is the absolute value of -5 equal to 5?
print("\nIs abs(-5) == 5? I predict True.")
print(abs(-5) == 5)
