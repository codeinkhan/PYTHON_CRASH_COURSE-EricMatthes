#3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person's name, print a message to them.
#       The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person's name.


names=['Programmer','Hacker','Developer','Tester'];
print("Hey "+names[0]+", You Are Welcome")
print("Hey "+names[1]+", You Are Welcome")
print("Hey "+names[2]+", You Are Welcome")
print("Hey "+names[3]+", You Are Welcome")
